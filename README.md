### Hi there, Meet JulietðŸ‘‹

I'm Juliet, a backend-focused engineer and sometimes a writer(depnds on how free I am). I am a very enthusiastic and result-driven person, I like to get things done and I'm also one that loves to learn and collaborate with other developers within and outside my field.
When I'm not coding or writing, I like to read on articles, books, try new cooking recipes and really cool stuff I can lay my hands on.
I'm still growing and I hope to meet a lot of people to work and collaborate with in the future.
